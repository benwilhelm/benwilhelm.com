<p>This was a prototype that I built a while back to create a firefly effect for a show that I was designing.&nbsp; Ultimately we went with a storebought solution, but it did expose me to the wonder of the <a title="Arduino Home Page" href="http://arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino board</a> and the many things you can build with it.&nbsp; Anyone interested can <strong>download</strong> the code for this effect <a title="Firefly Arduino Sketch" href="http://benwilhelm.com/files/2012/03/fireflyLoop.pde" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
